# Mission-to-Mars
A Python app for scraping web data pertaining to a Mission to Mars, stored in MongoDB (a NoSQL database), and displayed on an HTML page. The scrape button will pull the latest Mars news from NASA's Mars site (https://redplanetscience.com), grab the latest featured image from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (https://spaceimages-mars.com), grab a Mars/Earth facts table from Galaxy Facts (https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/), and finally pull the 4 full-size Mars hemisphere images from the USGS website (https://marshemispheres.com/). The HTML page is responsive for various devices and is formatted with Bootstrap CSS.
